   - ✅ Added `hasUsedTrial` field to Subscription model
   - ✅ Tracks whether user has ever used their free trial

2. **Trial Eligibility Service**
   - ✅ `src/lib/trialService.ts` - Checks if user can get free trial
   - ✅ `checkTrialEligibility()` - Returns eligibility status and reason
   - ✅ `markTrialAsUsed()` - Marks trial as consumed when started

3. **API Enhancements**
   - ✅ `src/app/api/billing/subscribe/route.ts` - Checks trial eligibility before creating subscription
   - ✅ `src/app/api/billing/trial-eligibility/route.ts` - Frontend API to check eligibility
   - ✅ Enhanced logging for trial decisions

4. **Frontend Updates**  
   - ✅ `src/app/billing/subscribe/page.tsx` - Dynamic UI based on trial eligibility
   - ✅ Different messaging for eligible vs ineligible users
   - ✅ Button text changes based on trial status

## 🧪 **Test Scenarios**

### **Test 1: First-Time User (Should Get Trial)**
1. **Create new account**: Sign up with new email
2. **Go to subscription page**: Should see "🎉 You're eligible for a 14-day free trial!"
3. **Check button**: Should say "Start [Plan] Trial"
4. **Subscribe**: Creates trial subscription with `hasUsedTrial: true`

### **Test 2: User Who Cancelled Trial (Should NOT Get Trial)**
1. **Use account that cancelled trial**: Login with account that used trial before
2. **Go to subscription page**: Should see orange warning "Free trial already used"
3. **Check message**: "Free trial has already been used. Payment required for subscription."
4. **Check button**: Should say "Subscribe to [Plan]"
5. **Subscribe**: Creates paid subscription immediately (no trial period)

### **Test 3: Current Trial User (Should NOT Get Another Trial)**
1. **Use account with active trial**: Login with account currently on trial
2. **Go to subscription page**: Should see "Currently on free trial"
3. **Subscription creation**: Should not create duplicate trial

### **Test 4: Active Subscription User**
1. **Use account with active paid subscription**: Login with paying customer
2. **Go to subscription page**: Should see "Already have an active subscription"
3. **Requires password**: Should ask for current password to change plan

## 🔍 **Verification Methods**

### **Check Trial Eligibility API**
```bash
# While logged in, check:
GET /api/billing/trial-eligibility

# Expected responses:
# First-time user:
{
  "success": true,
  "isEligible": true,
  "reason": "eligible",
  "message": "Eligible for 14-day free trial"
}

# Used trial before:
{
  "success": true,
  "isEligible": false,
  "reason": "already_used", 
  "message": "Free trial has already been used. Payment required for subscription."
}
```

### **Check Database**
```javascript
// In MongoDB, subscription document should show:
{
  "hasUsedTrial": true,  // If user ever started a trial
  "status": "trialing",  // For current trial users
  "trialEndsAt": "2024-11-06T...",  // Trial end date
}

// For users who used trial before:
{
  "hasUsedTrial": true,
  "status": "cancelled",  // If they cancelled
  "trialEndsAt": null,    // No current trial
}
```

### **Check Subscription Creation Logs**
```bash
# Server console should show:
"Trial eligibility check: {
  ownerId: '...',
  isEligible: false,
  reason: 'already_used',
  shouldStartTrial: false
}"
```

## 🎯 **Expected Behaviors**

| User Status | Trial Eligible? | Subscription Type | Button Text |
|-------------|----------------|------------------|------------|
| **New user** | ✅ Yes | 14-day trial | "Start [Plan] Trial" |
| **Used trial before** | ❌ No | Immediate payment | "Subscribe to [Plan]" |
| **Current trial** | ❌ No | Already trialing | "Currently on trial" |
| **Active subscriber** | ❌ No | Plan change | "Change Plan" |
| **Cancelled (never trialed)** | ✅ Yes | 14-day trial | "Start [Plan] Trial" |

## 🚨 **Critical Test Points**

1. **Trial Abuse Prevention**: Users who cancel trial cannot get another trial
2. **First-time Experience**: New users get trial as expected
3. **Payment Flow**: Non-eligible users are charged immediately
4. **Database Integrity**: `hasUsedTrial` field accurately tracks usage
5. **UI Messaging**: Clear communication about trial status

## ✅ **Success Indicators**

- **New users**: Get 14-day free trial
- **Previous trial users**: Must pay immediately, no trial option
- **Clear messaging**: Users understand why they can't get trial
- **Database tracking**: `hasUsedTrial` field prevents abuse
- **Razorpay integration**: Immediate vs delayed subscription start works correctly

## 🔧 **Debug Tools**

### **Trial Eligibility Check**
```
GET /api/billing/trial-eligibility
```

### **Subscription Debug Info**  
```
GET /api/debug/subscription-status
```

### **Browser Console**
Look for trial eligibility logs:
```javascript
console.log('Trial eligibility check:', {
  isEligible: false,
  reason: 'already_used'
});
```
