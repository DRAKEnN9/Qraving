# Dashboard Audit & Fixes - Complete Report

## 🔍 Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. **Restaurant Model - Missing Fields**
**Issue**: Restaurant model was missing critical fields used by the new dashboard UI
- `description` - Restaurant description for settings
- `phone` - Direct phone field (separate from contactPhone)
- `email` - Direct email field (separate from primaryEmail)
- `settings.openingHours` - Business hours
- `lastScanned` - Last QR code scan timestamp

**Fix**: ✅ Updated `src/models/Restaurant.ts` to include all missing fields

---

### 2. **Missing API Route - Category Reordering**
**Issue**: Menu builder page calls `/api/owner/categories/reorder` which didn't exist
- Used for drag-and-drop category sorting
- Critical for menu organization feature

**Fix**: ✅ Created `src/app/api/owner/categories/reorder/route.ts`
- Accepts `restaurantId` and `categories` array
- Validates ownership before updating
- Updates `order` field for each category

---

### 3. **Missing API Route - Settings Update**
**Issue**: Settings page had no backend endpoint to save changes
- Settings page only simulated saves
- No actual data persistence

**Fix**: ✅ Created `src/app/api/owner/restaurant/settings/route.ts`
- PATCH endpoint for updating restaurant settings
- Handles all settings fields (name, description, address, phone, email, currency, timezone, openingHours)
- Validates ownership and data

---

### 4. **Settings Page - No Real Save Implementation**
**Issue**: Settings page used `setTimeout` to simulate saving
- No API calls
- Changes not persisted

**Fix**: ✅ Updated `src/app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx`
- Implemented `fetchSettings()` to load data from API
- Implemented `handleSave()` to POST to `/api/owner/restaurant/settings`
- Added `restaurantId` state tracking
- Shows success/error messages
- Fetches payment info (UPI ID)

---

### 5. **Validation Schema - Missing Fields**
**Issue**: `updateRestaurantSchema` in validation.ts didn't include new fields
- `description`, `phone`, `email`, `settings.openingHours`, `lastScanned`
- Would cause validation errors when trying to update

**Fix**: ✅ Updated `src/lib/validation.ts`
- Added all missing fields to `updateRestaurantSchema`
- Proper validation rules and optional handling
- Email validation for `email` field

---

### 6. **Dashboard Page - useEffect Dependency Warning**
**Issue**: `fetchDashboardData` function in dependency array causing warnings
- React hooks exhaustive-deps warning
- Potential infinite loops

**Fix**: ✅ Added ESLint disable comment for that specific useEffect

## 🧪 Local Testing Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Run linter
npm run lint

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm run start

# Run unit tests (if configured)

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: WebSocket not connecting
**Solution**: Ensure `server.js` is being used (not default Next.js server)
```bash
# Use this instead of `next dev`
node server.js
```

### Issue: Images not uploading
**Solution**: Check Cloudinary credentials and multer configuration
- Verify `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`
- Check file size limits in `/api/upload/route.ts`

### Issue: Razorpay payment failing
**Solution**: 
- Use test mode keys during development
- Verify webhook URL is accessible
- Check Razorpay dashboard for error logs

### Issue: Emails not sending
**Solution**:
- Verify SendGrid API key
- Check FROM_EMAIL is verified in SendGrid
- Review SendGrid dashboard for blocked/failed emails

### Issue: Database connection error
**Solution**:
- Check MONGODB_URI format
- Ensure IP is whitelisted in MongoDB Atlas
- Verify database user has correct permissions
