## 🔍 WHY PHONEPE SHOWS ERROR

### **Invalid UPI IDs That WILL Fail**:

```
❌ test@paytm         → Doesn't exist in UPI network
❌ demo@ybl           → Fake ID, not registered
❌ restaurant@upi     → Invalid provider
❌ myshop@paytm       → Doesn't exist
❌ 123456@paytm       → Not registered
```

### **Valid UPI IDs That WILL Work**:

```
✅ 9876543210@paytm   → Real mobile number registered
✅ yourname@ybl       → Real registered ID
✅ business.name@oksbi → Real business UPI
✅ shop123@paytm      → If registered in UPI system
```

---

## 📱 UPI ID FORMAT RULES

Valid UPI ID must have:
1. **Valid username**: Letters, numbers, dots, hyphens
2. **@ symbol**
3. **Valid provider**: paytm, ybl, oksbi, icici, etc.
4. **Must be registered** in UPI network

**Examples**:
```
yourname@paytm        ✅
your.business@ybl     ✅
9876543210@paytm      ✅
shop-123@oksbi        ✅
```

## 🛠️ DEBUGGING UPI ERRORS

### **Check 1: Verify UPI ID Exists**

**Test your UPI ID**:
1. Open any UPI app (GPay/PhonePe)
2. Try sending ₹1 to your own UPI ID
3. If it works → UPI ID is valid ✅
4. If error → UPI ID doesn't exist ❌

### **Check 2: Check UPI Link Format**

Look at console when placing order:
```javascript
Generated UPI link: upi://pay?pa=yourname@paytm&pn=Restaurant&am=54.00&cu=INR...
```

**Verify**:
- ✅ `pa=` has valid UPI ID
- ✅ `am=` has proper amount (decimals ok)
- ✅ `cu=INR` currency code
- ✅ No spaces in UPI ID

### **Check 3: Amount Format**

**Valid amounts**:
```
✅ am=54.00
✅ am=100.50
✅ am=1234.99
```

**Invalid amounts**:
```
❌ am=54,00      → Comma not allowed
❌ am=₹54.00     → Currency symbol not allowed
❌ am=54         → Should have decimals
```
